  dialogueSequence:
  - Hello! You must be the new captain.
  - 'Welcome to S/2009 S1, or, as some of us call it: the "should have never been
    a base" moon.'
  - As you know from the briefing, this place is a flying golden nugget. Or better
    said, a flying Phlebotinum nugget.
  - It is as rich in ores and minerals as it is showered by asteroids. Oh boy, do
    we have some falling stars here!
  - Oh, sorry! I forgot to introduce myself. I am Titan, at your service.
  - 'I am here to show you your accommodations and post: the turret!'
  - The turret is our primary mechanism of protection, and it is also a powerful
    harvesting tool. The turret's blasters absorb asteroids' material on impact and
    teleport them to our base.
  - Do not worry if some meteors get past your shootings. Our shields are up and
    loaded to cover us from any debris that lands on the surface. We are safe. For
    now. Haha.
  - Oh, sweet Phlebotinum.
  - Well, I think that's it. If you have any questions, please, click away. It is
    free of charge. Literally.
  - I hope you last longer than the previous captain and do not sleep during a meteor
    shower. They are magnificent.
  - As it is our lovely Phebotinum.
