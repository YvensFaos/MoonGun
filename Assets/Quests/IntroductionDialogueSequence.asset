  - 'Hello! You must be the new captain.

    Welcome to S/2009 S1, or, how some
    of us call it: the "should have never been a base" moon.'
  - "As you should know from the briefing, this flying piece of rock is full of interesting
    minerals. It is as rich of Phlebotinum as it is target of an unstopable asteroid
    rain. Oh boy. We do have some falling stars here.\t"
  - 'But anyway, where are my manners. I am Titan, your loyal servant. I was told
    to show you our lovely accomodations and point you to where you will spend most
    of your time: the turret.

'
  - The turret is our main mechanism of protection. But fear not, for now, it is
    mostly a harvesting mechanism than a proper defense. Our shields should hold
    the impact of any asteroid, so do not bother.
  - The turret's cannon can absorb some of the asteroids material on impact, and
    those can be used for further technological advanced. Oh, sweet Phlebotinum.
  - Well, I think that is it. If you have any questions, please, feel free to just
    click around and I hope you have a lovely stay in the turret. Not like the previous
    captain that mostly slept through the meteor showers.
