  - Hello! You must be the new captain.
  - 'Welcome to S/2009 S1, or, how some of us call it: the "should have never been
    a base" moon.'
  - As you know from the briefing, this place is a flying golden nugget. Or better
    said, a flying Phlebotinum nugget.
  - It is as rich in ores and minerals as asteroids shower it. Oh boy, we have some
    falling stars here!
  - Oh, sorry! I forgot to introduce myself. I am Titan, at your service.
  - 'I am here to show you your accommodations and point of command: the turret!'
  - The turret is our primary mechanism of protection, and it is also a powerful
    harvesting tool. Its blasters absorb asteroids' material on impact.
  - But do not worry too much. We have shields to cover us for any scrap that lands
    on the surface. We are safe. For now. Haha.
  - Oh, sweet Phlebotinum.
  - Well, I think that is it. If you have any questions, please, click away. It is
    free of charge. Literally.
  - I hope you last longer than the previous captain and do not sleep during a meteor
    shower. They are magnificent as it is our lovely Phebotinum.
