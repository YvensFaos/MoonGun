Hello. You must be the new captain!

Welcome to S/2009 S1, or, how some of us call it: the "should have never been a base" moon.

As you know from the briefing, this place is a flying golden nugget. Or better said, a flying Phlebotinum nugget.

It is as rich in ores and minerals as asteroids shower it. Oh boy, we have some falling stars here!

Oh, sorry! I forgot to introduce myself. I am Titan, at your service.

I am here to show you your accommodations and point of command: the turret!

The turret is our primary mechanism of protection, and it is also a powerful harvesting tool. Its blasters absorb asteroids'' material on impact.

But do not worry too much. We have shields to cover us for any scrap that lands on the surface. We are safe. For now. Haha.

Oh, sweet Phlebotinum.

Well, I think that is it. If you have any questions, please, click away. It is free of charge. Literally.

I hope you last longer than the previous captain and do not sleep during a meteor shower. They are magnificent as it is our lovely Phebotinum.
