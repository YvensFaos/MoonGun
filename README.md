MoonGun - for the Game Off 2020

Most of the assets are from free/paid resources and are not currently part of this repository.
With that, downloading the repository will not allow you to fully play the game in Unity, but should contain all the code done by me for most of it.

DOTween (Free Version) and LeanPool (Free Version) were extensively used in the code and are also not part of the repository. You can simply install them using Unity's Package Manager.

You can play the game at: https://yre03.itch.io/moongun
